            The data reflects the impact of several waves of economic crashes, particularly around the early 2000s and 2008, on the proportion of profitable IPOs for all kinds of companies. However, we also see an increasing gap in the percent profitability of tech and biotech company IPOs and other company IPOs over the last thirty or so years. This may be due to a shift in investor sentiment, sending a strong signal that investors aren't buying what veneture capitalists are selling. On the other hand, some of the most valuable startups, such as Uber, are intentionally holding off on IPOs. By staying private longer, companies can run lucrative fundraising rounds and expand their growth without worrying about security regulations and investor relations.
